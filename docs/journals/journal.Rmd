# Makefile

This is what my makefile looks like graphically at the minute:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(rprojroot::find_root("Makefile"),"/figures/make.png"))
```

# Monday 29.10.2018

1. Initialise repository

2. Move data into `raw` data folder, make sure not in repository. 

3. What are the data files? Outline sheets

# Tuesday 30.10.2018

1. Finish the CHAT file outline

2. Go through all files and complete outline of data. write up in `01-data_outline.Rmd`

3. Update makefile

# Thursday 22.11.2018

1. OK, now I'm meant to do some 'analysis'. 

2. OK, so first thing is consolidating all the data into one file. Doing this manually will be a pain, but also really bad practice. Let's see if `readxl` might not be an option.

3. OK, Dandelion 2014 done. 

4. Dandelion 2015 - mixed data in one of the date cells... A bitch to disentangle programmatically, ha. 

5. OK, dandelion 2016. Had to remove a whole "funding period", not sure how this works!

6. Tried to dabble with moving averages, but got a bit too intense..

7. OK, Dandelion 2017
