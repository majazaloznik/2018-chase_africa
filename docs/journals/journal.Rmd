# Makefile

This is what my makefile looks like graphically at the minute:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(rprojroot::find_root("Makefile"),"/figures/make.png"))
```

# Monday 29.10.2018

1. Initialise repository

2. Move data into `raw` data folder, make sure not in repository. 

3. What are the data files? Outline sheets

# Tuesday 30.10.2018

1. Finish the CHAT file outline

2. Go through all files and complete outline of data. write up in `01-data_outline.Rmd`

3. Update makefile

# Thursday 22.11.2018

1. OK, now I'm meant to do some 'analysis'. 

2. OK, so first thing is consolidating all the data into one file. Doing this manually will be a pain, but also really bad practice. Let's see if `readxl` might not be an option.

3. OK, Dandelion 2014 done. 

4. Dandelion 2015 - mixed data in one of the date cells... A bitch to disentangle programmatically, ha. 

5. OK, dandelion 2016. Had to remove a whole "funding period", not sure how this works!

6. Tried to dabble with moving averages, but got a bit too intense..

7. OK, Dandelion 2017

# Friday 23.11.2018

1. Hmm, should I actually keep the odd ones, the weird funders? I mean in the end they will presumably be still in the analysis, so I might as well sort this out now...

2. OK, back to 2016 and add "amplify change" back in. 

3. And back to 2017 with Amboseli added in. 

4. 2018 now. Found error in pills CYP in the final sheet. 

5. OK, all data together now. Start row bind with 2018 dataframe, just to keep the columns in that order, since there are most in that table. 

6. Now sort by date. 

7. Now update makefile. I really need to start doing this earlier, not later!

8. Update readme

9. TODO:

* prepare presentation folder/gh_pages
* group data monthly?

# Monday 26.11.2018

1. Preapre presentation folder/gh_pages.. xaringan, right?

2. ALso update readme and add to makefile.

3. OK, now what to do with the data. Should I have a look at another dataset? No, keep it simple and do dandelion only.

4. Start preliminary analysis report. 

5. Rename variables so they are fp_ family planning, ihs for integrated health services and fund for funding related stuff. 

6. Derive totals for family planning and check with the ones in the excel spreadsheet - correct. 
7. Derive CYP totals
